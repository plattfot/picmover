Moving pictures and videos from one location to another. Useful for importing files from a camera. 

Note only tested on with a Nikon D7000 and D750 and Nokia 6700.

Known limitations:
- Can only handle one Camera per date.
- Cannot extract camera model and maker from MOV files, so it will either use the default model and maker or if it also reads in images taken on the same date it will use that camera model and maker.
